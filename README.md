# RideSafeSG - Safe Riding VR Simulator

RideSafeSG aims to allow cyclists and PMD users to
practice safe riding on Singapore roads, walkways and shared paths. Alongside this, this
project also aims to help non-cyclists to emphasize with cyclists on the road.

The VR application will simulate various environments cyclists and PMDs will face on
Singapore roads such as walkways, Park Connector Networks and roads. Environmental
conditions may also be simulated including but not limited to night riding and day riding.
